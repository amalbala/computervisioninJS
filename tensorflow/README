Testing TensorFlow.js project

To be able to load the model from local file, bypassing CORS requirements a small python script must be runned to  
generate a http server on the file folder.

Inside ./tensorflowjs just run:  

python simple_cors_server.py

And the model should be available on http://localhost:8003/model.json  

So just open index.html in your favourite browser and check the console logs
